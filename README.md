## Running the apps

### Setup local environment
```sh
# ==============
# Database Setup
# ==============

# Start the local postgres db container
npm run db:start
# Verify container is running without issues
npm run db:logs
# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate
# Run local Drizzle Kit Studio
npm run db:client
# Stop Drizzle Kit Studio
npm run db:client:kill

# ===============
# App Setup
# ===============

# Run local serve
npm run dev:byndr
# Or run on docker compose
npm run serve:localhost
```

## Additional helpful commands
```sh
# prefix for running Drizzle Kit CLI commands 
npm run dk # usage: npm run dk -- migrate

# prefix for Drizzle Kit via the e2e test DB
npm run dk:test # usage: npm run dk:test -- migrate
```
## Running Tests
Most projects will expose a nx `test` target.  Some e2e projects like `import-tools` require additional environment setup:
```sh
# Running e2e commands for import-tools
npm run byndr:test
```

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Explore the Project Graph
Run `nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
